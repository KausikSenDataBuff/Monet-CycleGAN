## Generative Monet: A GAN-based Art Style Transfer Challenge

This repository holds the code for the "Generative Monet" competition, where participants will use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create images in the style of the famous impressionist painter Claude Monet.

**The Challenge**

Artists are recognized for their unique style, and with GANs, we can now bridge the gap between data science and artistic expression. This competition challenges you to build a GAN that can generate **7,000 to 10,000 images** resembling Monet's iconic impressionist style.

**Can you trick the eye?**

GANs consist of two parts: a **generator** and a **discriminator**. The generator creates new images, while the discriminator acts as a judge, trying to distinguish between real Monet paintings and the ones your generator produces. Through this adversarial process, both models improve: the generator learns to create more convincing forgeries, and the discriminator hones its ability to spot fakes.

**Your Mission**

* Implement a GAN architecture capable of generating Monet-style images.
* Train your model on a dataset of Monet paintings (dataset not provided).
* Fine-tune the hyperparameters to achieve high-quality image generation.
* Generate the target number of images (7,000 to 10,000) capturing Monet's style elements like soft brushstrokes, light play, and vibrant colors.

**Getting Started**

This repository provides a basic framework to get you started. You'll need to:

* Install required libraries (refer to `requirements.txt`).
* Download and pre-process the Monet dataset (not included). 
* Implement the generator and discriminator models.
* Train the GAN and monitor its performance.
* Generate the final set of Monet-inspired images.

**Evaluation**

Submissions will be evaluated based on:

* **Image Quality:** Realism and adherence to Monet's style.
* **Diversity:** Variety of generated images within the chosen style.
* **Code Clarity:** Readability and maintainability of your code.

**Additional Resources**

* A detailed explanation of GANs can be found [here](link to GAN explanation article).
* Tutorials on building GANs with popular libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) can be found online.

**Let's get creative!**

This competition provides a platform to explore the power of GANs for artistic expression. We encourage you to experiment and showcase your skills in generating stunning art inspired by the master himself, Claude Monet.
